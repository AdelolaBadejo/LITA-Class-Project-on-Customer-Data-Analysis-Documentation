From the Pivot Table: 
- The Basic subscription type has the highest customer and subscription duration and so generated the highest revenue.
- The East region hes the highest customer and generated the highest revenue.
- The False Cancelled has the highest customer and subscription duration and generated the highest revenue.
- in conclusion The East region has the highest Basic subcription type with the highest subscrtion duration and generated the highest revenue
