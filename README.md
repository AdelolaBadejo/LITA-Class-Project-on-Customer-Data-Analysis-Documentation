- The average subscrption duration 365.3498 was calculated using the Average formular.
- The most popular subscription type Basic was identified using the countif functions 

#### From Pivot Table: 

- The Basic subscription type has the highest customer and subscription duration and so generated the highest revenue.
- The East region has the highest customer and generated the highest revenue.
- The False Cancelled has the highest customer and subscription duration and generated the highest revenue which means
   most customers have active subscription, their subscription were not cancelled.
- in conclusion The East region has the highest Basic subcription type with the highest subscrtion duration and generated the highest revenue

1. Tailor marketing strategies and campaign on customer preference  and behaviour in each region to enhance brand visibility
   and customer engagement
2. Develop plans to promote the subcription of Premium and Standard in regions with lower subscription to increase subcription demands
